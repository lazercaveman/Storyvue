# About Storyvue
Storybook is a nice tool for developing UI components. Unfortunately the Vue support is not as good as I would like it to be, the setup is also complicated and cumbersome.

With Storyvue I would like to work on a tool based on Vue.js, which offers the same functionality as Storybook, with the difference that it is a Vue App, which supports the documentation, testing and visualization of Vue components and avoids additional configuration. 

## Why
Using Storybook requires (at least if you want to use Vue) a configuration that exists parallel to the Vue related configuration. 

A realization of such a tool based on Vue allows to use extensions, which are included for the development of the components, also for the execution of the tools without having to configure them explicitly, since the tool simply uses the vue cli.

## When
Since time is rare, I do not know when I will find time to continue working on the tool. At the moment I use it only as an app, to manage a small private project. On the long run the tool shell be available as vue extension - right now it is just a simple vue application itself. I currently don't know when I'll find time to do further improvements - if someone likes to participate, you're welcome...

# About Storyvue
Storyvue is a Vue based app, which helps me creating, document & manage my own, Vue related component libraries. I developed the app as a side project and will continue to work on it. Since the app is based on Vue, you can easily integrate your own components and use the dependencies (included in Storyvue).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

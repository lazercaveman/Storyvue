# storyvue
Storybook is a nice tool for developing UI components. Unfortunately the Vue support is not as good as I would like it to be, the setup is also complicated and cumbersome.

With Storyvue I would like to work on a tool based on Vue.js, which offers the same functionality as Storybook, with the difference that it is a Vue App, which supports the documentation, testing and visualization of Vue components and avoids additional configuration. 

## Why

Using Storybook requires (at least if you want to use Vue) a configuration that exists parallel to the Vue related configuration. 

A realization of such a tool based on Vue allows to use extensions, which are included for the development of the components, also for the execution of the tools without having to configure them explicitly, since the tool simply uses the vue cli.

## When

Since time is scarce, I do not know when I will find time to continue working on the tool. At the moment the "foundation" has been laid, there is still much to do and to improve.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
